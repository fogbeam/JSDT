Overview of changes in JSDT v2.3

* Adjusted all copyright messages to be 1996-2005.
* Made sure the zip distribution included the .../jsdt-src-2.3/build 
  files and a compiled version (JDK 1.4) of JSDT under 
  .../jsdt-src-2.3/build/solaris/lib-debug

Overview of changes in JSDT v2.2

* Added in support for a JGroups reliable multicast implementation, and made
  this the default multicast implementation (the alternative is LRMP).
* Removed all references to the RMF/RAMP multicast implementation (as this
  is no longer available for download).
* Instructions have been updated in the top-level README to describe
  what needs to be done to setup to build the JGroups and/or LRMP
  multicast implementations.
* Adjusted code to build with JDK 1.5.0.
* Fixed up all the deprecated method warnings in the JSDT toolkit classes
  (and implementations).
* Fixed up the two deprecated method warnings in the sound example.
* Fixed up 5 out of 6 of the deprecated warnings in the ppong example.
* Adjusted .../socket/SSLSocketFactory.java to use the SSL Socket code in 
  the javax.net.ssl classes.
* Removed all references to USE_SSL and SSL_CLASSES from the README and the 
  build environment.
* Updated section 8.2.2. of the User Guide to use the only default cipher 
  available (SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5) and remove the sentence indicating 
  that you need to supply the SSL socket package.
* Q12 of the JSDT FAQ now covers how to setup SSL socket supprt. See:
  https://jsdt.dev.java.net/files/documents/1222/4670/JSDT-FAQ.html#Q12
* Rewrote the browser example to use the Swing toolkit (with the JEditorPane 
  widget doing the HTML rendering) rather than the ICE browser Java bean.
* Adjusted the top-level README and the build hierarchy to remove
  all references to the ICE Browser.
* Browser example titleline now includes "[Teacher]" for the first started 
  version.
* With the browser example, if a URL is incorrect, a dialog now displays an 
  error message.
* Changes to decrement the noThreads count of the number of created
  DataReceivedThreads when a data received thread terminates (after handling 
  the received messages). Done for socket, http and multicast implementations.
* Removed references to SOUND_CLASSES in the top-level README and the 
  Makefile.defs and Makefile.config files as the Java sound classes are 
  now a standard part of the JRE/JDK.
* Adjusted the protection level of the various setShutdown methods. They 
  should not be public.
* Preparation for building irrespective of the build platform. Added 
  preliminary ANT build file.
* Changed the getManagerId() method in com.sun.media.jsdt.http.ManageableServer
  to public to make the HTTP protocol version compile again.
