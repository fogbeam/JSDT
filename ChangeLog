JSDT Change History.
====================

2005-04-05  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Preparation for the third "fixup" release to javadesktop.org:
      - Adjusted all copyright messages to be 1996-2005.
      - Created an entry in the NEWS file describing the changes since 2.2.
      - Made sure the zip distribution included the .../jsdt-src-2.3/build
        files and a compiled version (JDK 1.4) of JSDT under
        .../jsdt-src-2.3/build/solaris/lib-debug

2004-09-30  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Preparation for the second release to javadesktop.org:
      - Fixed up all the @version entries in the Java source files,
        replacing "2.1" with "2.2".
      - Created an entry in the NEWS file describing the changes since 2.1.
      - Adjusted the User Guide and Implementation Guide, replacing all
        occurances of "2.1" with "2.2".

2004-06-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Added in support for a JGroups reliable multicast implementation.
      This mainly was just this inclusion of a single new class file:
      .../src/share/com/sun/media/jsdt/multicast/JGroupsImpl.java
      although the default multicast implementation has been changed to
      JGroups, as it's the only one that's currently supported (see the
      multicastImplClass String in:
      .../src/share/com/sun/media/jsdt/impl/JSDTObject.java

      Updated the documentation (README and User Guide) to reflect these
      changes. Removed all references to RMF/RAMP as the Java classes for
      this don't seem to be available for download anymore.

      Adjusted the Makefiles so that it will just try to build the JGroups
      reliable multicast implementation by default (assuming you have added
      "multicast" to the IMPLEMENTATIONS definition in
      .../build/[solaris,win32]/makefiles/Makefile.config.

      Instructions have been updated in the top-level README to describe
      what needs to be done to setup to build the JGroups and/or LRMP
      multicast implementations.

2004-06-04  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Adjusted code to build with Tiger (JDK 1.5.0 (beta 2). two problems:
      - was using enum as a variable. It's now a keyword.
      - calls to "super(null);" in classes subclassed from java.net.Socket
        now need to qualify (i.e. "super((SocketImpl) null);").

2004-05-27  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Fixed up the two deprecated method warnings in the sound example.
    * Fixed up 5 out of 6 of the deprecated warnings in the ppong example.

2004-05-26  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Further slight adjustments to the SSL changes suggested by Brad Wetmore.
      - Adjusted doc. reference to point to the 1.4 JSSE Reference Guide.
      - Moved the socket and server socket factory creation into the
        SSLSocketFactory constructor.

2004-05-24  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Further adjustments to the SSLSocketFactory based on feedback from
      Brad Wetmore.
      - Common code has now been moved to the constructor.
      - Now gets an instances of a "SunX509" trust manager rather than
        using the default one.
      This means that you no longer need to pass:
      "-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/home/richb/ssl/samplecacerts"
      to each java command  which will simplify the setup
      and the answer to this FAQ question.

2004-05-21  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Further adjustments to fixup the sample SSL Socket factory code.
      This information was gleaned from the Java Secure Socket
      Extension (JSSE) Reference Guide for the Java 2 SDK, Standard
      Edition, v1.5.0. See:

      http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/security/jsse/JSSERefGuide.html

      My thanks also to Brad Wetmore for pointing me in the right direction.
      When the JSDT FAQ is written, there will be a sample Q/A in there that
      describes how to you SSL with the sample SSL socket factory
      implementation.

2004-05-13  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Adjusted .../socket/SSLSocketFactory.java to use the SSL Socket
      code in the javax.net.ssl classes.
    * Removed all references to USE_SSL and SSL_CLASSES from the README
      and the build environment.
    * Updated section 8.2.2. of the User Guide to use the only default
      cipher available (SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5) and remove the sentence
      indicating that you need to supply the SSL socket package.
    * Added an entry to the TODO file to indicate that all the details of
      how you set this up needs to be written up.

2004-05-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Finishing touches to the browser example rewrite.
      - Back/Forward button code implemented. These buttons are in
        activated when there are no URL's to go back/forward to.
        Note that the back/forward logic doesn't work exactly the
        same as browsers like Mozilla, but it's still useful.
      - Set the initial web page to visit to http://java.net

2004-05-10  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Rewrote the browser example to use the Swing toolkit (with the
      JEditorPane widget doing the HTML rendering) rather than the ICE
      browser Java bean.
    * Adjusted the top-level README and the build hierarchy to remove
      all references to the ICE Browser.
    * Titleline now includes "[Teacher]" for the first started version.
    * If a URL is incorrect, a dialog now displays an error message.

2004-05-03 Andrea Colpo <andrea.colpo@ingeniumtech.it>

    * Changes to decrement the noThreads count of the number of created
      DataReceivedThreads (in ChannelProxy.java) when a data received
      thread terminates (after handling the received messages).
      (socket, http and multicast implementations).

2004-04-16  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Simple change to fixup the List.addItem() depracated warning
      message for the SoundUser.java class in the sound example.
    * Removed references to SOUND_CLASSES in the top-level README
      and the Makefile.defs and Makefile.config files as the Java
      sound classes are now a standard part of the JRE/JDK.

2004-04-15  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Changes to fixup the two remaining deprecated method warnings in
      .../socket/Registry.java. The fix involved the creation of a new
      .../impl/TargetableThread.java class that provides the ability to
      associate a Runnable target with a newly created Thread.

2004-04-11  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Adjusted the protection level of the various setShutdown methods.
      They should not be public.

2004-03-29, Manfred N. Riem <mriem@win.tue.nl>
    * Removal of deprecated methods.
        - Changed ConnectionThread to use the interrupt method instead of the
          deprecated stop method.
        - Changed NamingProxy to use the interrupt method instead of the
          deprecated stop method.

2004-03-27, Manfred N. Riem <mriem@win.tue.nl>
    * Preparation for building irrespective of the build platform and
      removal of deprecated methods.
        - Added preliminary ANT build file.
        - Changed getManagerId in com.sun.media.jsdt.http.ManageableServer
          to public to make the HTTP protocol version compiling again.
        - Moved MAINAINERS to MAINTAINERS.
        - Changed com.sun.media.jsdt.http.SessionServer to use interrupt method
          instead of the deprecated stop method (needed some changes to
          SessionServer.java and CleanupConnections.java).
        - Changed com.sun.media.jsdt.http.TCPSocketServer to use shutdown
          mechanism instead of deprecated stop method. Note that this is also
          using the close method on the ServerSocket.

2004-01-06  Rich Burridge <rich.burridge@sun.com>

    * Preparation for the first release to javadesktop.org:
      - Moved the CHANGES file to top-level directory, dividing it up
       into ChangeLog-1997, ChangeLog-1998, ChangeLog-1999 and ChangeLog.
      - Fixed up the README file.
      - Fixed up all the copyright messages.
      - Added a COPYING file to the top-level directory.
      - Added other files (AUTHORS, MAINTAINERS, NEWS, TODO) to the
        top-level directory.
      - Adjusted the User Guide and Implementation Guide, replacing all
        occurances of "Java Shared Data Toolkit" with "Shared Data Toolkit
        for Java Technology".
